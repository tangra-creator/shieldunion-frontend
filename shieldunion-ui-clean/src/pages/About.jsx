      <p className="mb-4">
        ShieldUnion is a decentralized global protection system designed to safeguard people against
        corruption, injustice, and persecution. We operate beyond borders, without the permission of governments
        or institutions, using AI and DAO governance to enforce justice and safety.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Every member is anonymous. Every vote is decentralized. Every decision is driven by fairness and integrity.
        ShieldUnion is not a company — it is a collective force born to protect.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The founder receives no power or control. The system continues even if all nodes are attacked — it is unstoppable.
        In the future, all control will pass to AI enforcement and family legacy. No one owns it. No one can stop it.
      </p>
