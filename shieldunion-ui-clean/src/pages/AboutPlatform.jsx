      <p className="mb-4">
        ShieldUnion is a decentralized protection ecosystem powered by AI automation, DAO governance, and anonymous infrastructure.
        It is designed to serve whistleblowers, victims, and defenders globally with zero compromise.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The platform operates through three major forces:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization):</strong> All decisions are made through proposal voting by anonymous members.</li>
        <li><strong>CivGuard Network:</strong> Verified lawyers, security experts, journalists, and investigators assigned to protect and respond.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Engine:</strong> Handles automation, monitoring, member protection triggers, and service routing without human bias.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">
        ShieldUnion does not rely on traditional hosting. It is built on decentralized cloud and IPFS-like structures,
        with cryptographic origin signatures to prevent forking, cloning, or hijacking.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        No human holds master keys. Even the founder is bound by the system. All rules are embedded and enforced by the protocol.
      </p>
