      <p className="mb-4">
        Shieldunion is a global decentralized protection platform built to defend individuals, families, and ethical organizations from injustice, persecution, and corruption.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Operated by AI and governed through a transparent DAO, Shieldunion does not rely on governments, corporations, or individual controllers. It is unstoppable, self-sustaining, and cryptographically authenticated at every layer.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The founder, known as <strong>Tangra</strong>, retains permanent earnings rights as platform originator but has no manual control over operations or member decisions. All power belongs to the DAO and platform engine.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        CivGuard professionals are verified through strict criteria and must follow Shieldunion's justice-first code of ethics. Our only mission is protection.
