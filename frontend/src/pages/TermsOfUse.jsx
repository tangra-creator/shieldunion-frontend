        By using Shieldunion, you agree to operate within the platform’s protected system, governed by DAO consensus and smart AI routing. This platform exists solely for the protection of individuals, families, and communities from injustice, corruption, and persecution.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Users must be of legal age or guaranteed by a legal-age third party. All submissions are final, and access to services is subject to case verification, membership validation, and DAO approval.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        No user may interfere with platform automation or override DAO outcomes. Shieldunion is a sovereign digital union; no government, corporation, or individual may claim ownership or request takedown of its services without DAO consent.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        All payments, protection claims, and interactions are logged in a cryptographic ledger controlled by the system — not by any human operator. Attempts to clone, impersonate, or fraudulently use the platform will result in permanent denial and blacklisting.
